            I am a Frontend and Backend developer with the desire to learn
            every day and put it into practice in the workplace, I have been studying
            new technologies
            in order to update my knowledge and be able to continue my path as an Engineer.
            I have always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side.
            When I discovered web design in college, I realized that
            would fit perfectly. I could use my creative side to design
            and my logical side to program. As a bonus, being a designer
            and developer allows me to make sure that no detail is lost
            in the production.
